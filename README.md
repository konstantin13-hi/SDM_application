## Description

The Lesson Diary Application is designed to facilitate teachers in managing attendance and grading for their classes. The application consists of two main modules: Attendance Management and Grades Entry. It allows multiple teachers to use the system, each managing various subjects and courses.

Features:
1. Attendance Management Module
-Teacher Access: Each teacher can create and manage multiple courses.

-Course Creation: While creating a new course, the teacher provides the course name and enters student information (first name and last name).

-Course Start Date: The teacher specifies the start date of the classes, which are scheduled to occur cyclically.

-Attendance Tracking: Teachers can mark students as present or absent during each class session. The application allows for flexibility in marking attendance (e.g., present, absent, excused).

-Attendance History: At any time, teachers can check the attendance history of students for classes that have already taken place, enabling them to monitor attendance patterns and trends.

2. Grades Entry Module

-Assessment Forms: Teachers can define various forms of knowledge assessment (e.g., quizzes, tests, oral responses).

-Grade Entry: Teachers have the ability to input grades for each assessment form, providing a comprehensive view of student performance.

-Grade Management: The system allows for the modification of previously entered grades, ensuring that students can improve upon their earlier assessments.

-Final Grade Calculation: The application automatically calculates the final grade as the average of all assessment scores, providing a transparent and fair evaluation of student performance.
